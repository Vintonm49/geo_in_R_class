# Geospatial Module Intro

** First, restart your R session.**

- There are multiple packages in R that allow you to "roll your own maps" without expensive and often not available GIS software.  

- These packages also offer functions to enable geospatial analysis and manipulation of spatial data.

- The goal of this module is to demonstrate some simple methods for creating maps and displaying data on maps.
